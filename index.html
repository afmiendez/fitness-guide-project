                    <h2>PPLxUL</h2>
                    <p>The PPLxUL (Push, Pull, Lower, Upper, Lower) workout split is a 5-day complete workout split perfect for balancing high intensity workouts with a fair number of rest days to maximise hypertrophy throughout the body muscles. What makes this workout split special is the fact that it becomes possible to exercise the muscle groups twice a week while still being able to rest a lot. There are numerous factors when it comes to muscle hypertrophy such as daily protein intake, the suplements used, the daily calorie intake, healthy resting, etc.</p>
                    <p>Check out the other pages for a full explanation on every exercise for every day.</p>
                    <h2>Progressive Overload</h2>
                    <p>To increase muscle hypertrophy you have to give your muscles a reason to grow, that is, pushing yourself to your limit. Bringing your reps (repetitions) to or close to failure is equivalent to making progress. Each week, you should aim to increase the weight on every exercise by a small amount. Eventually, your strength will increase quick as well as muscle size.</p>
                    <h2>Importance of rest days</h2>
                    <p>Resting well is one of the most (if not the most) important factors in achieving muscle hypertrophy. Sleeping 7-9 hours a day is as important as training hard and eating well because its when you give your muscles time to grow and improve its strength. Combining these 3 habits will guarantee quick progress in the gym and avoid injuries. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Always warmup before starting your workouts. It avoids injuries and gets you ready to push yourself even further.</li>
                    <li>If you feel your forearms giving up before your back on a pull day, you can always buy straps to help holding weights.</li>
                    <li>Take your time adjusting to heavy weights, it is not worth risking an injury to try and impress others. </li>

                    <li>Make sure to ingest a diet high in protein, with the recommended amount of daily protein intake (grams) being double your bodyweight in kilograms.</li>
                    <li>Calculate your maintenance calories to see how much do you need to eat daily to gain weight or to lose it.</li>
